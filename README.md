# loa-res-split
LoA resources split. I added the original resources from Expansion.dsres and (German) ExpVoices.dsres, and rebuild them into somewhat smaller chunks:
- ExpCore.dsres
- ExpObjects.dsres
  - ExpObjects - actors.dsres
  - ExpObjects - items.dsres
- ExpTerrain.dsres
- ExpSoundEffects.dsres
- ExpMusic.dsres
- ExpMovies.dsres
- ExpVoices.dsres
  - ExpVoices - dialog.dsres
  - ExpVoices - voiceover.dsres
- ExpSiegeEditorExtras.dsres

Why? I'm just playing around here... Maybe this can be useful for a backport to Vanilla, or for excluding Island-of-the-Utraeans themed equipment from other maps' pcontent... Heck I don't know what to do with it and now GitHub started charging me for LFS usage :weary:

## Attribution
All of these resources are from Gas Powered Games and Mad Doc Software, not me. I'm just re-tanking them here.
